Apple Crumble is an augmented reality mobile game which allows players to go outside to complete scavenger hunts to complete quests and earn badges. It was partially inspired by Pokemon Go and Maplestory. You receive these quests from digitally-rendered NPCs and are asked to find items that advance the in-game storyline. Players can just point their phones at the items they need to find, and the Vuforia AR camera responds to the correct matching targets. Users are able to log in, keep track of the badges they earned in their badge box page. Users also can recieve hints as well as check their quest log for more information about their quest.
